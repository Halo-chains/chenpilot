# Requirements Document: Compatibility-Safe Prompt and Agent Version Control System

## Introduction

This document specifies requirements for evolving the existing basic prompt versioning system into a production-grade version control system with advanced deployment safety, compatibility management, and rollback capabilities. The system will enable controlled rollout of prompt and agent changes with automatic safety mechanisms, compatibility contracts between components, and comprehensive metrics integration.

## Glossary

- **Version_Control_System**: The enhanced prompt and agent versioning system that manages deployment, rollback, and compatibility
- **Prompt_Version**: A specific version of a prompt template with associated metadata, content, and deployment configuration
- **Agent_Version**: A specific version of an AI agent configuration including its prompts, tools, and behavior settings
- **Activation_Policy**: A deployment strategy that controls how a new version is rolled out (canary, gradual, instant)
- **Rollback_Manager**: Component responsible for detecting failures and reverting to previous stable versions
- **Compatibility_Contract**: A formal specification of dependencies and requirements between prompts, agents, and tools
- **Deployment_Configuration**: The set of parameters controlling version activation, traffic distribution, and safety thresholds
- **Metrics_Collector**: Component that gathers performance, quality, and business metrics for version evaluation
- **Canary_Deployment**: A rollout strategy where a new version receives a small percentage of traffic initially
- **Gradual_Rollout**: A rollout strategy where traffic is incrementally shifted to a new version over time
- **Health_Check**: An automated evaluation of version performance against defined success criteria
- **Compatibility_Validator**: Component that verifies compatibility contracts before allowing version activation
- **Version_Registry**: Central repository storing all version metadata, configurations, and compatibility information
- **Traffic_Router**: Component that distributes requests across active versions based on activation policy
- **Metric_Threshold**: A defined boundary for metrics that triggers automatic actions (rollback, promotion)
- **Stable_Version**: A version that has passed health checks and is considered safe for production traffic
