## Introduction

The Simulation Stack Hardening feature transforms the existing simulation infrastructure from a development scaffolding tool into a production-grade pre-execution environment. This hardened simulation stack will provide deterministic dry-runs, systematic failure injection, and high-fidelity execution previews that operators and users can trust for making critical decisions about blockchain operations before committing them to live networks.

The current simulation stack provides basic capabilities for local testing with simulated latency and random error injection. The hardened version will add deterministic reproducibility, comprehensive failure modeling, execution trace capture, state snapshot/restore capabilities, and validation mechanisms that ensure simulation fidelity matches real-world execution behavior.
